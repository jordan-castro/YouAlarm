# YouAlarm

Have you ever wanted to wake up to your favourite song? I recently got a Google Pixel 6 and with it, a free 7 day subscription to YoutubeMusic.
With that subscription in my hands I could wake up to whatever song I wanted to listen to. But alas, I didn't want to use the app. So I decided to write this little app that would allow me to do that. It is very simple. It dosen't look very nice, but it gets the job done. You could also use Spotify if you have a subscription, but let's not list every other way that you can wake up to your favourite songs alright? This was just a fun project.
